# Did the 2019 estallido social lead to divergent shifts in institutional trust, democratic support, and economic outlook across socioeconomic, geographic, age and ideological groups in Chile?
## Introduction
Chile’s rapid economic growth from the 1980s through the early 2000s is often referred to as one of Latin America’s economic miracles. This economic success is largely attributed to its embrace of neoliberalism, with extensive trade liberalization, privatization, and minimal government intervention. However, Chile remains a highly unequal society, a stark reality revealed by the nation-wide social protests in 2019 after the government decided to increase the per metro fare by four percent (Edwards, 2023). Although this hike is equivalent to only thirty pesos, or approximately four U.S. cents, it triggered the largest scale protest in the country’s democratic history. This event raises a critical question: how did a booming, high-income nation celebrated as a successful economic model face such widespread intense public discontent over a relatively minor policy change?

## Research Question
This research paper investigates how Chileans’ attitudes toward democracy, economic conditions, and institutional trust shifted before and after the 2019 estallido social. I hypothesize that the groups most actively involved in the protests, particularly younger, urban, left-leaning, and lower-income citizens would show more negative shifts in their perceptions of democracy, institutional trust, and both personal and national economic outlook. 

## Data
This study uses data from the Latinobarómetro, a regional public opinion survey conducted annually across 18 Latin American countries. The survey covers a wide range of political, economic, and social topics and includes a nationally representative sample of approximately 1,200 respondents in Chile. To evaluate how public attitudes shifted before and after the 2019 estallido social, I apply a Differences-in-Differences (DiD) framework. This method allows for a comparison between groups that were more likely to be affected by the protests and those that were not, helping to isolate the relative impact of the protest period on key political and economic attitudes.

## Conclusion
The findings suggest that Chileans did not experience a uniform decline in attitudes following the protests. Instead, the most notable changes occurred among groups more likely to be affected by the events, particularly younger, lower-income, urban, and left-leaning individuals. 
### Economic Outlook
Altogether, economic perceptions deteriorated the most among groups that had once been more optimistic, such as the affluent, urban, middle-aged, and politically conservative.
### Democratic Attitudes
Dissatisfaction with democracy in the post-estallido period was especially acute among the upper-income, ideologically moderate-to-conservative, and middle-aged Chileans.
### Trust in institutions
The gains in institutional trust post-2019 were specific to governmental institutions and concentrated among youth and the economically marginalized.
